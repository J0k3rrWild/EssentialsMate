# EssentialsMate


Advanced and very usable administration and server security plugin for pocketmine (API 3.26.2) 

Because old essentials are outdated and lack of functionality, I made my own.


TODO:


* Make documentation
* Add English translate (because polish is supported only)
* Add API 4.x support

But anyway is done and If you want, you can translate it yourself and use.

use /help to list all commands
